Python offers several built-in data structures for storing collections of data.

- Lists: Ordered, mutable sequences. Example: [1, 2, 3]
- Tuples: Ordered, immutable sequences. Example: (1, 2, 3)
- Sets: Unordered, unique elements. Example: {1, 2, 3}
- Dictionaries: Key-value pairs. Example: {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}

You can access list elements using indices. Dictionary values are accessed using keys. Sets support operations like union and intersection.

Each data structure serves different purposes based on the requirements of the program.
