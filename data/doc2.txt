Control flow in Python refers to how a program decides what to do next based on conditions and repetition.

Conditional statements use the `if`, `elif`, and `else` keywords. Example:
x = 5
if x > 0:
    print("Positive")
else:
    print("Non-positive")

Loops in Python include `for` and `while` loops. The `for` loop is commonly used to iterate over sequences like lists or strings.

Logical operators include `and`, `or`, and `not`, which can combine or invert boolean expressions.
