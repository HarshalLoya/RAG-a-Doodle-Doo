Python is a popular programming language known for its readability and ease of use. It uses indentation to define code blocks instead of curly braces. Python supports both object-oriented and functional programming styles.

Variables in Python are dynamically typed, meaning you donâ€™t have to declare their type explicitly. For example:
x = 10
name = "Alice"

Python has several built-in data types such as integers, floats, strings, and booleans. The `type()` function can be used to check the data type of a variable.

Comments are written using the hash symbol (#), and Python files use the `.py` extension.
