Answer:
Based on the provided information, the following are features of Python:

1. **Readability and ease of use**
2. **Indentation-based code blocks** (instead of curly braces)
3. **Support for object-oriented and functional programming styles**
4. **Dynamically typed variables** (no need to declare type explicitly)
5. **Built-in data types**: integers, floats, strings, booleans
6. **Built-in data structures**: Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries
7. **Functions**: defined using `def` keyword, can take arguments, return values, support default and keyword arguments
8. **Modular code**: functions reduce repetition and improve code structure
10. **Function scope**: determines which variables are accessible
11. **Comments**: written using the hash symbol (#)
12. **File extension**: `.py`

Let me know if you'd like me to clarify or expand on any of these features!

Answer:
According to the provided information, Python offers several built-in data structures for storing collections of data, which are:

1. **Lists**: Ordered, mutable sequences. Example: `[1, 2, 3]`. You can access list elements using indices.

2. **Tuples**: Ordered, immutable sequences. Example: `(1, 2, 3)`.

3. **Sets**: Unordered, unique elements. Example: `{1, 2, 3}`. Sets support operations like union and intersection.

4. **Dictionaries**: Key-value pairs. Example: `{"name": "Alice", "age": 25}`. Dictionary values are accessed using keys.

Each data structure serves different purpose based on the requirements of the program.
